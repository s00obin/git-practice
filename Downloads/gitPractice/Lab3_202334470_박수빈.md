# My Project Plan (Level 1 Heading)
***Note:*** This document is written merely as an illustractive example, and dose not provide any working guide to an actual project.

### Proposal (Level 3 Heading)
-------
I am planning to make a computer vision software that detects objects in images.  
In order to build it, I will use opencv, deep learning libraries, such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=ko) or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), and open source sortwares.

For example, the objects in the following images were detected using [mmdection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection):

### Dependencies (Level 3 Heading)
- python
- opencv-python
- tensorflow
- openmmlab
- package manager

### Installation 
In a bash terminal, run the following commands (do NOT actually run these commands in your computer):
```sh
$ sudo apt update
$ conda create -n cv_detection
$ conda activate cv_detection
$ python --version
$ python example.py
```
